## Flask Application Design for a Todo Chat Application

### Overview
We aim to create a Flask web application that serves as a chat-style todo list. Users can interact with the application through text input, creating, modifying, and deleting tasks.

### HTML Files
We'll need two HTML files: `index.html` and `styles.css`.

- `index.html`:
  - This file will handle the user interface. It will include a chat-like interface with an input field for users to enter tasks.
  - Additionally, it will display a list of existing tasks in the chat style.

- `styles.css`:
  - This file will contain CSS styles to format the HTML elements like the input field, task list, and buttons.

### Routes
We'll define three routes for our application:

1. `/`:
   - This is the root route. When users access the application, they'll be directed to this route.
   - The route will render the `index.html` file, which will display the chat-style todo interface.

2. `/add_task`:
   - When users enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button, a POST request will be sent to this route.
   - The route will receive the task data and store it in a suitable data structure (e.g., a database or a Python list).
   - After saving the task, the route will redirect the user back to the root route (`/`).

3. `/delete_task`:
   - When users click the "Delete" button next to a task, a POST request will be sent to this route with the task's unique identifier.
   - The route will use the identifier to locate and delete the task from the data structure.
   - After deleting the task, the route will redirect the user back to the root route (`/`).

### Additional Considerations
- To handle the task storage, you can utilize various technologies like a SQLite database or a Python list.
- For a more user-friendly experience, you can implement features like task editing, task status tracking, and task filtering.
- To improve the overall design, you can add more CSS styles or incorporate JavaScript for dynamic interactivity.
